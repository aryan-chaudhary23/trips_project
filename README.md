# trips_project
Here data is fetched from other files.
We can either click on intrested or not interested.
If we click on interested only that trip is shown.
However if we click on not interersted it removes the particular trip from the screen.
If we click on not interested on all the trips a page is shown saying no trips left and a button to reload the trips.
